# PointMassSim
Point Mass Lap Time Simulator created as part of my Master Thesis "Energy Consumption Estimation in Lap TimeSimulation"

Please read "summary.pdf" for a detailed summary of my work in this Master Thesis. In this work I modeled a Formula Student car, a GreenPower car and a LMP3 from the European LeMan Series category.
For NDA reasons, data related to the LMP3 can not be made public but the Formula Student and the GreenPower are still available.
